            <p>
                Bob and Sheila, owner-operators of Paradise Connections Yacht
                Charters, are experienced sailors whose goal is to assist you in
                finding the best boat for your charter yacht sailing vacation.
              </p>

                Bob grew up around boats in Southern California, while Sheila's only
                boating experience was riding a ferry a couple of times. We met, got
                married and went to France in 1980. We lived on a péniche (French
                barge) for a few years on the Seine river outside of Paris. This is
                where we got the boat-building bug.
              </p>
              <p>
                After building a few dinghies and a kayak, we decided to tackle a
                large project -- a 26-foot liveaboard sailboat. Within six months we
                were living aboard Loose Moose on the Marne river east of Paris.

            <h3>What we do</h3>
                <p>
                love love love... We are a bit different to other charter yacht
                brokers. The crew of Paradise Connections live in the Caribbean
                islands year round aboard our personal sail boat. We keep in touch
                with the boats and crews as they are our friends and neighbors.
